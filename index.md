I'm Alex, a mathematican based in Tonbridge, England. 

I've been the chief content architect at [Math Academy](/math-academy.html) since 2017. I started off just writing tutorials, but this quickly expanded into managing an entire team of content developers. We now have a team of over ten mostly Ph.D. mathematicians contributing to our enormous content-base every day.  

I have a Ph.D. in mathematics from University College London. 

I've taught math to hundreds of students over the years. My of my experience is at undergraduate and A-level. Finding ways to effectively communicate math at *all* levels in my passion.

I've been married for forteen years, and have one son who is six years old.  

I call myself the Math Ninjas because (a) I think it's a cool-sounding name, and (b) I was a pretty good martial artist in my youth.

Some math:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$
