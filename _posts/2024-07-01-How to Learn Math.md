Learning math independently is hard because most people don't know how. 

This is an extension of a post that recently (and unexpectedly!) blew up on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/ninja_maths/status/1807689513621188781). I thought I'd post it here too, as many people found it useful.

Let's dive in! 

## 1. Active Learning

You don't become proficient in math just by reading books or watching videos like those from 3Blue1Brown or Khan Academy.

This is known as "passive learning." 

To truly grasp mathematics, you need to engage in **active learning,** which means solving lots and lots of math problems. 

For more advanced learners, this also includes writing lots of proofs.

While many recommend 3Blue1Brown as a good starting point for advanced topics like linear algebra, I believe this is misguided. 

Their videos are beautifully presented and enjoyable (I love them myself), but they are most beneficial _after_ you have a solid understanding of the underlying material, not before.

## 2. Regular Review

Without regularly reviewing material, you're likely to forget it. Establish a review schedule to ensure you're revisiting content at optimal intervals, which increases the likelihood of retaining the information.

## 3. Quizzing

Challenge yourself with regular quizzes to utilize the **testing effect,** which enhances your ability to recall information without looking it up. 

Aim to derive key results independently.

## 4. Mastery of Prerequisites

Many people want to jump into advanced topics like machine learning or university-level probability and statistics from the start.

However, lacking foundational prerequisites can make these courses incredibly challenging.

Attempting an advanced math course without mastering the basics is like stepping into the ring with two-time heavyweight world champion Anthony Joshua for a sparring session with a minimal six-week fitness training camp as preparation.

You might think you're "fit enough" to manage and have enough in the tank to get through. Maybe he'll go easy on you?

**Spoiler Alert!** It won't end well, you won't enjoy it, and your boxing skills won't improve due to getting your ass demolished in 10 seconds!

This is why we created Math Academy.

Our system handles all these aspects (and more), which means our students can make incredible progress simply by completing the learning tasks selected by our intelligent algorithms.
